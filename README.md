Satellite Image Analytics for Tree Enumeration and Species Detection
Diversion of Forest Land Project

Overview
This project leverages satellite imagery and advanced machine learning techniques to analyze forested areas for tree enumeration, species detection, and green cover analysis. It aims to provide a comprehensive solution for monitoring and evaluating forest resources to aid decision-making processes, particularly in the context of land diversion projects.

Features
Tree Enumeration: Automatically count the number of trees in satellite images.
Species Detection: Identify tree species such as palm and spruce using YOLOv8.
Green Cover Analysis: Assess the density and extent of vegetation.
Satellite Image Processing: Process and analyze satellite imagery for high accuracy and efficiency.
Report Generation: Generate detailed reports, including pie charts, for visualization and documentation.
Technologies Used
Programming Languages: Python
Frameworks: Flask (for web interface and APIs)
Machine Learning Model: YOLOv8 for object detection and species classification
Cloud Tools: Google Colab for training models
Database: MySQL (optional for storing metadata)
Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (for web-based interface)
System Architecture
Input: Satellite images are uploaded to the system.
Processing: Images are processed using trained YOLOv8 models for tree enumeration and species detection.
Analysis: Outputs from the models are combined and analyzed for green cover insights.
Reporting: A PDF report is generated with visualizations, including pie charts for detected species and tree counts.
